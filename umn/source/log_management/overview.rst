Overview
========

LTS manages logs by log group and stream for easy classification. Before using LTS, create a log group and then multiple log streams in the group. By collecting and storing log data in different log streams, you can search, analyze, and transfer log data and set alarm rules by log stream.

To better understand and use LTS, perform the following steps:

#. Create a log group. For details, see :ref:`Managing Log Groups <lts_04_0003>`.
#. Create a log stream. For details, see :ref:`Managing Log Streams <lts_04_0004>`.
#. On the **Log Management** page, view resource statistics, and the **My Favorites**, **My Favorites(Local Cache)**, and **Recently Visited** lists. For details, see :ref:`Viewing Log Management <lts_04_1154>`.

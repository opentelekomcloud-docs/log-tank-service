My Favorites/My Favorites (Local Cache)
---------------------------------------

This area displays the log streams you have added to favorites, including **My Favorites** and **My Favorites (Local Cache)**.

-  **My Favorites**: Save log streams to the database. This function is disabled by default. If your account has the write permission, **My Favorites** and **My Favorites (Local Cache)** are displayed.
-  **My Favorites (Local Cache)**: Save log streams to the local cache of the browser. This function is disabled by default. **My Favorites (Local Cache)** is displayed for all accounts.

   .. note::

      If your account has the write permission, at least one of **My Favorites** and **My Favorites (Local Cache)** is enabled. Otherwise, log streams cannot be added to favorites.

You can customize a list of your favorite log streams for quickly locating frequently used log streams.

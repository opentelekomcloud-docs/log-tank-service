Upgrading ICAgent
=================

To deliver a better collection experience, LTS regularly upgrades ICAgent. When LTS prompts you that a new ICAgent version is available, you can follow the directions here to obtain the latest version.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the LTS console and choose **Agent Management** in the navigation pane on the left.

#. Select one or more hosts where ICAgent is to be upgraded, and click **Upgrade ICAgent**.

#. In the **Upgrade ICAgent** dialog box, click **Yes**.

   The upgrade begins. This process takes about a minute. When the ICAgent status changes from **Upgrading** to **Running**, the ICAgent upgrade has completed.

   .. note::

      If the ICAgent status is abnormal after the upgrade or if the upgrade fails, log in to the host and run the installation command. ICAgent can be re-installed on top of itself.

Log Collection
==============

To reduce the memory, database, and disk space usage, you can set log collection as required. The log collection switch is used to determine whether to collect log data.

#. Log in to the LTS console, choose **Configuration Center** in the navigation pane on the left, and click the **Log Collection** tab.

#. Enable or disable **Log Collection**.

   .. note::

      This function is enabled by default. If you do not need to collect logs, disable this function to reduce resource usage.

      After the log collection function is disabled, ICAgents will stop collecting logs, and this function on the AOM console will also be disabled.

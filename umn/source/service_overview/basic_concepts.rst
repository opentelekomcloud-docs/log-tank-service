Basic Concepts
==============

Log Groups
----------

A log group is the basic unit for LTS to manage logs. You can query and transfer logs in log groups. Up to 100 log groups can be created in your account.

Log Streams
-----------

Up to 100 streams can be created in a log group.

You can separate logs into different log streams based on log types, and name log streams in an easily identifiable way. This helps you quickly find your desired logs.

ICAgent
-------

ICAgent is the log collection tool of LTS. If you want to use LTS to collect logs from a host, you need to install ICAgent on the host. Batch ICAgent installation is supported if you want to collect logs from multiple hosts. After ICAgent installation, you can check the ICAgent status on the LTS console in real time.

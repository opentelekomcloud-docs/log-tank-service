Does LTS Delete Logs That Have Been Transferred to OBS Buckets?
===============================================================

No. During log transfer, logs are "replicated" to OBS buckets. To view transferred log files, click the name of the corresponding OBS bucket on the **Log Transfer** page of the LTS console, and you will be directed to the OBS console to check the files.

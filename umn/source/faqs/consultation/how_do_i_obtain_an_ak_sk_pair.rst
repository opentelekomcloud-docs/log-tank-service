How Do I Obtain an AK/SK Pair?
==============================

An access key ID and secret access key (AK/SK) constitute an access key.

-  AK: access key ID, which is a unique identifier used in conjunction with a secret access key to sign requests cryptographically.
-  SK: secret access key used in conjunction with an AK to sign requests cryptographically. It identifies a request sender and prevents the request from being modified.

Obtain and use the AK/SK of a public account.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the console, hover your cursor over your username in the upper right corner, and select **My Credentials**.
#. Choose **Access Keys**.
#. Click **Create Access Key** and enter a description.
#. Click **OK** and download the AK/SK immediately.
#. Obtain the AK/SK pair from the **credentials** file.

.. note::

   Up to two access keys can be created for each user. An access key can be downloaded only right after it is created. Keep it secure after it is generated. If the **Create Access Key** button is grayed out, delete an access key first before creating one.

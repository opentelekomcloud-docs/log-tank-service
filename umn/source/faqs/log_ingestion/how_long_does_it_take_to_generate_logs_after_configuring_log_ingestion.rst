How Long Does It Take to Generate Logs After Configuring Log Ingestion?
=======================================================================

After configuring log ingestion on the **Log Ingestion** page of the LTS console, click the target log group on the **Log Management** page to access the details page, choose the corresponding log stream, and click the **Real-Time Logs** tab. If real-time logs are displayed, log ingestion is successful.

Wait for 1 to 5 minutes. You can then view the reported raw logs on the LTS console.

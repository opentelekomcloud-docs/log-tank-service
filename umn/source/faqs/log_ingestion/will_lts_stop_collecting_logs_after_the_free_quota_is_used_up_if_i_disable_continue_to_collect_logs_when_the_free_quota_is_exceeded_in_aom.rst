Will LTS Stop Collecting Logs After the Free Quota Is Used Up If I Disable "Continue to Collect Logs When the Free Quota Is Exceeded" in AOM?
=============================================================================================================================================

Yes.

The enablement/disablement status of log collection is synchronized between LTS and AOM. Likewise, if you set the log collection to be stopped when the free quota is used up in AOM, the setting is also applied to LTS.
